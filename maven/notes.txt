## 🔥 Servlet Learning Roadmap

### 🧱 1. **Introduction to Servlets**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand what servlets are and their role in Java web applications.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- What is a Servlet?
- Servlet Lifecycle
- Why use Servlets?
- Setting up a servlet project (with Tomcat + IDE like IntelliJ/Eclipse)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a simple servlet that responds with “Hello from Servlet!”

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Servlet Lifecycle (Detailed)**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Learn how a servlet is created, initialized, handles requests, and destroyed.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `init()`, `service()`, `doGet()`, `doPost()`, `destroy()`
- Request flow: Client → Web Server → Servlet Container

#### 🧪 Example:
Print logs in each method to see the lifecycle in action.

---

### 🧾 3. **Working with Request and Response Objects**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Learn how to receive and send data between client and server.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `HttpServletRequest`
- `HttpServletResponse`
- Reading form parameters (from HTML)
- Setting headers, response status, and content type

#### 🧪 Example:
Build a form (HTML) that sends user input to the servlet. The servlet processes and returns a custom message.

---

### 📦 4. **Servlet Configuration**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand how servlets are configured and mapped.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `web.xml` (deployment descriptor)
- Annotations (`@WebServlet`)
- URL patterns and servlet naming

#### 🧪 Example:
Map two servlets with different URL patterns. Show how they’re triggered.

---

### 📂 5. **Session Management**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Manage user data across multiple pages (like login sessions).

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Cookies
- HTTP Sessions (`HttpSession`)
- URL Rewriting

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a basic login system using sessions.

---

### 🔄 6. **Servlet Filters and Listeners**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Add logic before/after servlets and listen to context/session events.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Filters (`javax.servlet.Filter`)
- Listeners (`ServletContextListener`, `HttpSessionListener`, etc.)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a filter that logs all incoming requests and a listener that tracks online users.

---

### 🗃️ 7. **File Uploads & Downloads**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Handle file uploads and serve files for download.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `multipart/form-data`
- Apache Commons FileUpload library

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a servlet where users can upload a file, and another to download it.

---

### 🛡️ 8. **Security with Servlets**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand how to secure servlet-based apps.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Basic authentication
- Role-based access (`web.xml`)
- HTTPS basics

#### 🧪 Example:
Restrict access to certain servlets based on user role.

---

### 🧪 9. **Connecting Servlets with Databases (JDBC)**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Make servlets dynamic by interacting with a database.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- JDBC basics (Connection, Statement, ResultSet)
- Using connection pools (like HikariCP)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a “register user” form that saves data in a MySQL/PostgreSQL DB.

---

### 🧰 10. **Servlet Best Practices and Advanced Concepts**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Write clean, scalable, secure servlet code.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- MVC Pattern using Servlets + JSP
- ServletContext vs ServletConfig
- Error handling
- Asynchronous Servlets

---

## 📘 Learning Format:
- I’ll teach each module with:
  - ✅ Concepts & Visuals
  - 💻 Code Examples
  - 🧪 Small Hands-on Exercises
  - 🔍 Debugging Tips
  - 📚 Real-world Usage



Three things are important: 
    webapp-> folder with WEB_INF[contains web.xml] and index.html file

    on starting the server index.html rendered.

    Servlets is used to render different URL within the page.

    If we don't mention anything then it is a get request by default

    Until -> if there is change we need to restart the server.

    there are two method two call servlet from another servlet

    👁️👁️🧰  Req Dis and Redirect.


    ### Another important stuff.

    browser -> s1 -> s2 -> browser. this is how requestRedirect works. therefore the data sending in follow props drill method.


    Whereas, in SendRedirect() method browser send request to s1 -> browser -> s2 (mentioning that it is being redirected to s2), Here the concept of sessionManagement is important as the data of s1 is stored in session and may be send to s2 in future.


    Here we learn about redirect method and the use of methods.

    ServletContext ServletConfig -> these two are use to get initial value of the servlets

    the differnce b/w the two is ServletContext is shared among all servlets while ServletConfig using this we can specify which servlet should access this. 

    to instantiate context: <context-param>
    to instantiate config: <init-param>

    Another important thing about the two is we don't need to create an object of above as this is handle by tomcat.


    Let's learn JSP(java server pages)

    Syntax to write JSP.

    <%@ page import = "" this is termed as directive %> if any package is req.

    <%! this is act as declation, above that servlet.  %>

    <% scriptlet, this logic just goes directly to sevlet class and used  %> 

    <%= k, this is also called as expression. %> this means out.println(k) 

    Declation, Directive [@page, @include, @taglib], scriptlet, expression

    <%page attribute="" attribute="" attribute="" %>

    the attributes can be [

      language = "scripting language"
      extends="className"
      import="package"
      session="true|false"
      autoFlush="true|false"
      contentType="ctinfo"
      errorPage="error_url"
      isErrorPage="true|false"
      info="information"
      isELIgnored="true|false"
      isThreadSafe="true|false"
    ]

    <%@ include file="filename" %>
    <%@ include file="header.jsp" %>

    @taglib -> <%@ taglib url="" prefix="fx" %>
