## 🔥 Servlet Learning Roadmap

### 🧱 1. **Introduction to Servlets**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand what servlets are and their role in Java web applications.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- What is a Servlet?
- Servlet Lifecycle
- Why use Servlets?
- Setting up a servlet project (with Tomcat + IDE like IntelliJ/Eclipse)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a simple servlet that responds with “Hello from Servlet!”

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Servlet Lifecycle (Detailed)**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Learn how a servlet is created, initialized, handles requests, and destroyed.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `init()`, `service()`, `doGet()`, `doPost()`, `destroy()`
- Request flow: Client → Web Server → Servlet Container

#### 🧪 Example:
Print logs in each method to see the lifecycle in action.

---

### 🧾 3. **Working with Request and Response Objects**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Learn how to receive and send data between client and server.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `HttpServletRequest`
- `HttpServletResponse`
- Reading form parameters (from HTML)
- Setting headers, response status, and content type

#### 🧪 Example:
Build a form (HTML) that sends user input to the servlet. The servlet processes and returns a custom message.

---

### 📦 4. **Servlet Configuration**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand how servlets are configured and mapped.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `web.xml` (deployment descriptor)
- Annotations (`@WebServlet`)
- URL patterns and servlet naming

#### 🧪 Example:
Map two servlets with different URL patterns. Show how they’re triggered.

---

### 📂 5. **Session Management**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Manage user data across multiple pages (like login sessions).

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Cookies
- HTTP Sessions (`HttpSession`)
- URL Rewriting

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a basic login system using sessions.

---

### 🔄 6. **Servlet Filters and Listeners**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Add logic before/after servlets and listen to context/session events.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Filters (`javax.servlet.Filter`)
- Listeners (`ServletContextListener`, `HttpSessionListener`, etc.)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a filter that logs all incoming requests and a listener that tracks online users.

---

### 🗃️ 7. **File Uploads & Downloads**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Handle file uploads and serve files for download.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- `multipart/form-data`
- Apache Commons FileUpload library

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a servlet where users can upload a file, and another to download it.

---

### 🛡️ 8. **Security with Servlets**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Understand how to secure servlet-based apps.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- Basic authentication
- Role-based access (`web.xml`)
- HTTPS basics

#### 🧪 Example:
Restrict access to certain servlets based on user role.

---

### 🧪 9. **Connecting Servlets with Databases (JDBC)**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Make servlets dynamic by interacting with a database.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- JDBC basics (Connection, Statement, ResultSet)
- Using connection pools (like HikariCP)

#### 🧪 Example:
Create a “register user” form that saves data in a MySQL/PostgreSQL DB.

---

### 🧰 10. **Servlet Best Practices and Advanced Concepts**
#### 🎯 Goal:
Write clean, scalable, secure servlet code.

#### 📘 Concepts:
- MVC Pattern using Servlets + JSP
- ServletContext vs ServletConfig
- Error handling
- Asynchronous Servlets

---

## 📘 Learning Format:
- I’ll teach each module with:
  - ✅ Concepts & Visuals
  - 💻 Code Examples
  - 🧪 Small Hands-on Exercises
  - 🔍 Debugging Tips
  - 📚 Real-world Usage



Three things are important: 
    webapp-> folder with WEB_INF[contains web.xml] and index.html file

    on starting the server index.html rendered.

    Servlets is used to render different URL within the page.

    If we don't mention anything then it is a get request by default

    Until -> if there is change we need to restart the server.

    there are two method two call servlet from another servlet

    👁️👁️🧰  Req Dis and Redirect.
