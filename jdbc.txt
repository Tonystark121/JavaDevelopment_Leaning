JDBC -> Java Database Connectivity.

To connect java with db we require drivers, There are 4 type of driver such as 

To use we must follow these 7 steps:
    1. import the package
    2. Load & Register the driver
    3. Connecting/Establish the connection
    4. Create the statement
    5. Execute the query
    6. Process request
    7. Close request

Each db have its own driver, for mysql it's com.mysql.jdbc driver look for mysql connector.

Class.forName('driver_name') is method to register a driver.
instantiate the Connection interface.

Example Code:

1.import Java.sql.*
2. Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc Driver")
3. Connection conn = Driver getConnection("URL","UN","PW") -> URL: databse url, UN: user name, PW: user password 
4. statement st = com.CreateStatement()
5. ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select * from student")
6. rs.next()
7. rs.getInt(1) + " " + rs.getInt(2)
